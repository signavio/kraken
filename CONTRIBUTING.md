Feel free to submit PRs!

Every PR that adds new features or fixes a bug should include tests that cover
the new code. Also the code should comply to our common code style. You can use
the following commands in order to check that while you are developing.

```shell
# Install all dependencies
yarn

# Run the test suite
yarn test

# Check test coverage
yarn coverage

# Check whether you have any linting errors
yarn lint
```
